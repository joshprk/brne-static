## Game-Theoretic Static Obstacle Avoidance

This is an independent research project I did during my time as a student, which attempts to extend one of my favorite
works ([Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium for Crowd Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01537)) to avoid static
obstacles without a meta-planner in an efficient, optimal, and stable manner.
